    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>8 ounces plant-based hot Italian-style sausage (such as Beyond Meat®), chopped</li>
        <li>6 ounces cooked and crumbled ground meat substitute (such as BOCA)</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in plant-based sausage, meat substitute crumbles, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, 1 tablespoon parsley, sugar, basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 1 1/2 hours.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles; cook 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse noodles with cold water.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
        <p>Meanwhile, stir together egg, ricotta, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
        <p>To assemble lasagna, spread 1/3 of the sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella slices. Spoon 1/3 of the sauce over mozzarella and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan. Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
        <p>Bake, covered with cooking spray-coated foil, for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake until hot and bubbly, about 25 minutes more. Cool for 15 minutes before slicing into 12 equal servings.</p>
